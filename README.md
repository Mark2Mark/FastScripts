## Installation

Clone this repository with git or download .zip manually

***For Glyphs 2 change branch to Glyphs2!***

```
git clone https://github.com/simoncozens/GlyphsGit.git
```
Double click the plugin or move it into the Glyphs plugin folder. Reload glyphs.

## Usage

* Settins button - Set the required number of scripts (from 1 to 20), then restart Glyphs to apply the changes

* Add button - Add the required script (.py file)

* Save button - Save the current set of scripts

## Issues

After changing the number of scripts, a restart of Glyphs is required. Perhaps this problem can be solved through autolayouts, but so far this has not been successful.
